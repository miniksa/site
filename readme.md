Yo. This is the source code for building my website: [Niksa's Notes](https://niksa.dev).

It's a static website generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I use [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/) to build it, [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/) to host the content, and [Azure CDN](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cdn/) for the delivery.

You can see how the build is doing here: [![Build Status](https://fivefivefivefivefive.visualstudio.com/Niksa.dev/_apis/build/status/Niksa.dev%20Site?branchName=main)](https://fivefivefivefivefive.visualstudio.com/Niksa.dev/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=main)
