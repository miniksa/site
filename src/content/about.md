Hey there!

I'm Michael Niksa. I work as a software engineer at Microsoft on the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) team. I enjoy playing video games, automating my home, and reading about infrastructure... among other things. The rest might become obvious through these notes.

If you stumbled across this site, you've found just a collection of things that I thought were worthy of writing somewhere. Sometimes I have folks ask me about something I've done and I end up rambling back at them in chat for half an hour. And then I do it again next time I'm asked. And one day, I thought... hey... perhaps I should just start collecting them.

Maybe you'll find this useful; maybe you won't. That's on you, not me. :P

Also, no warranty. Everything here is the world as I understand it. It's generally some shade of true. I don't intend to mislead, but also I don't intend to spend my whole time validating everything. The point was to get the writing out... not to spend all day researching. If you do find something obviously wrong, file a bug to the [Github Issues](https://github.com/miniksa/site/issues/new).

For any other feedback, you could leave a discussion on [Github](https://github.com/miniksa/site/discussions) or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelniksa). Or if you want, you can email me. It's &lt;myfirstname&gt;.&lt;mylastname&gt;@outlook.com, substituting as appropriate.

Thanks for stopping by!

--Michael
