Okay, so I put it up in 2020. And then in some mix of depression, angst, anxiety, and just general blahs... I didn't really touch this thing save for a post about Home Automation. I didn't take it down either. 

But as we head into 2024, I'm feeling a lot better than I have in years and I think it's time to actually write. Definitely a more efficient, productive, and calming use of my time than endlessly doomscrolling on Reddit.

My goal is to write 100 notes in 2024. I do enough random crap that I find interesting that I could put it here to not lose it and maybe you'll find it interesting too.

If I don't make it or fall behind, you can make fun of me relentlessly via email or in real life. Future me, good luck!


### Addendum

I thought endlessly about maybe making this into some other sort of website where I could more easily edit it in a browser Wordpress style or with some other sort of CMS...which was a few of the things I originally tried here. Or perhaps use some sort of public blogger thing. But meh. This is here. It's exceedingly cheap. I actually set it up and it does somehow still function 4 years later with no changes. And honestly what's easier than dumping some text in a folder and typing `git push`. Should be nothing.
